I am a **Research Facilitator** at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Library. 

The **core of my work** is to understand the data and computing challenges researchers are facing and advise them on how to leverage best practices and tools to solve those challenges while helping them to make their work more open and reproducible. I am also a  **Lecturer**  in the Master in Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science)) program at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach "good enough" practices in reproducible and collaborative data science and data management.

My **scientific expertise** is in ecohydrology, Earth observation techniques (remote sensing and GIS), and process-based modeling. Prior to conducting my PhD on the ecohydrological impacts of tropical cyclones in the Southeastern US, I conducted several projects on land cover change, vegetation monitoring, and disaster mapping for governmental and international institutions.

Before this, I was a Data Engineer Lead in a tech company developing data pipelines to extract location insights from geospatial information.

I am also involved in the development of several R packages, including the `lterdatasampler` (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lterdatasampler/) in collaboration with [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst) and the `metajam` R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metajam/).

On the personal side, I enjoy chocolate crunching, downhill skiing, mountain biking, and playing records on vintage Hi-Fi!
