I'm a Senior Data Scientist at the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS), UC Santa Barbara. 

The core of my work is to understand data and computing challenges our researchers are facing and help them to translate these challenges into solvable tasks. I advise and train them on how to clean, structure, combine and analyze their heterogeneous data sets, as well as scaling up their analysis, while promoting reproducible science principles.
