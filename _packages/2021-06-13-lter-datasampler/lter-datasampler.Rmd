`lterdatasampler` is an R package that provides small data sets (data samples) from the Long Term Ecological Research program ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) to be useful for teaching and training in (environmental) data science. Each data set as an accompanying vignette that provides a teaching example. _Its content is thus not suitable for research and should only be used for teaching purposes._
