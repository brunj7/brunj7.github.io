`camelsquery` eases the processing of NCAR Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data using R. It requires as input a set of USGS stream gages (here for more). This package offers a function for downloading the CAMELS data automatically, a function to process CAMELS data and integrate them with USGS daily streamflow and water quality gauge data.
