## Abstract

The pandemic has shifted virtual collaboration from being something practiced by some people to being the primary mode of interaction for everyone for the foreseeable future. A lot of resources have been produced and shared to help people adapt to the challenges and liabilities of virtual collaboration. At NCEAS, we wanted to see if there were additional ways we could "leverage the liabilities" of virtual collaboration, to find things that virtual collaboration actually does better. Here are some things we have been experimenting with and the insights they are producing.
