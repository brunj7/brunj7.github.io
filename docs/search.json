For each critical challenge NCEAS awards after a proposal review process, a Working Group is formed of around 15-20 multi-disciplinary US and international experts from academia, NGOs, administrations and private sectors. NCEAS strives to help these working groups to do science differently by promoting and supporting best practices in open, team and data sciences.\nThe core of my work is to understand data and computing challenges our working group members are facing and help them to translate these challenges into solvable tasks. I advise and train them on how to clean, structure (data modeling), combine and analyze their heterogeneous data sets, as well as scaling their analysis. I am also an instructor in our data science training and summer school efforts teaching early career scientists data analysis and programming best practices, while promoting open and reproducible principles.\nMy scientific expertise is in ecohydrology, Earth observation techniques (remote sensing and GIS) and process-based modelling. Prior conducting my PhD on the ecohydrological impacts of tropical cyclones in the Southeastern US, I conducted several projects on land cover change, vegetation monitoring and disaster mapping for governmental and international institutions.\nBefore this, I was a Data Engineer Lead in a tech company developing data pipelines to extract location insights from geospatial information.\nI am also the maintainer for the metajam R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metajam/) and the organizer of the R Meetup in the Santa Barbara area. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea and would like help to organize a meeting!\nOn the personal side, I enjoy chocolate crunching, downhill skiing, mountain biking and playing records on vintage Hi-Fi!\n\n\n\n",
