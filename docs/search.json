For each critical challenge NCEAS awards after a proposal\nreview process, a Working Group of around 15-20 multi-disciplinary US\nand international experts from academia, NGOs, administrations, and\nprivate sectors is formed. NCEAS strives to help these working groups to\ndo science differently by promoting and supporting best practices in\nreproducible data science.\nThe core of my work is to understand the data and\ncomputing challenges our working group members are facing and help them\nto translate these challenges into solvable tasks. I advise and train\nthem on how to clean, structure (data modeling), combine and analyze\ntheir heterogeneous data sets, as well as scaling their analysis. I am\nalso an instructor in our data science training and summer school\nefforts teaching early-career scientists data analysis and programming\nbest practices while promoting open and reproducible principles.\nMy scientific expertise is in ecohydrology, Earth\nobservation techniques (remote sensing and GIS), and process-based\nmodeling. Prior to conducting my PhD on the ecohydrological impacts of\ntropical cyclones in the Southeastern US, I conducted several projects\non land cover change, vegetation monitoring, and disaster mapping for\ngovernmental and international institutions.\nBefore this, I was a Data Engineer Lead in a tech company developing\ndata pipelines to extract location insights from geospatial\ninformation.\nI am also the maintainer of the metajam R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metajam/) and\nthe organizer of the R Meetup\nin the Santa Barbara area. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea\nand would like help to organize a meeting!\nOn the personal side, I enjoy chocolate crunching, downhill skiing,\nmountain biking and playing records on vintage Hi-Fi!\n\n\n\n",
