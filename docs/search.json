I am also a Lecturer in the Master in Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach “good enough” practices in reproducible and collaborative data science and data management.\nMy scientific expertise is in ecohydrology, Earth observation techniques (remote sensing and GIS), and process-based modeling. Prior to conducting my PhD on the ecohydrological impacts of tropical cyclones in the Southeastern US, I conducted several projects on land cover change, vegetation monitoring, and disaster mapping for governmental and international institutions.\nBefore this, I was a Data Engineer Lead in a tech company developing data pipelines to extract location insights from geospatial information.\nI am also involved in the development of several R packages, including the lterdatasampler (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lterdatasampler/) in collaboration with Allison Horst and the metajam R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metajam/).\nOn the personal side, I enjoy chocolate crunching, downhill skiing, mountain biking, and playing records on vintage Hi-Fi!\n\n\n\n",
