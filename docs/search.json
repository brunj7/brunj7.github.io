I am also a Lecturer in the Master in Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach “good enough” practices in reproducible and collaborative data science and data management.\nMy scientific expertise is in ecohydrology, Earth observation techniques (remote sensing and GIS), and process-based modeling. Prior to conducting my PhD on the ecohydrological impacts of tropical cyclones in the Southeastern US, I conducted several projects on land cover change, vegetation monitoring, and disaster mapping for governmental and international institutions.\nBefore this, I was a Data Engineer Lead in a tech company developing data pipelines to extract location insights from geospatial information.\nI am also involved in the development of several R packages, including the lterdatasampler (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lterdatasampler/) in collaboration with Allison Horst and the metajam R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metajam/).\nOn the personal side, I enjoy chocolate crunching, downhill skiing, mountain biking, and playing records on vintage Hi-Fi!"

    "text": "In this module, we wanted to empower multi-institutional and cross-sectoral science teams to collaboratively develop reproducible workflows for data-driven projects. The idea was to take remote, decentralized teams and help them to develop a centralized mindset and toolkit for data & code while working remotely. Our goal was to expose participants to “good enough” tools and practices to develop common practices that will enable them to collaborate efficiently among each other, but also with their future selves. We focused on the centralization and management of the information, data and code they will be collecting and developing over their two-year project; stressing that for each part of their workflow, everyone should be encouraged and enabled to contribute no matter their technical skills."

Increasingly tools that document and help to organize workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility, shareability, and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows (including code, documents, and data) as a way to conduct reproducible analyses. These concepts will be combined with the practice of various software tools and collaborative coding techniques to develop and manage multi-step analytical workflows as a team.\nCourse website: https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/"
