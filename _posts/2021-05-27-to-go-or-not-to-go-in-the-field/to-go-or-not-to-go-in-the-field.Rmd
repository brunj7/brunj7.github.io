## Abstract

For researchers in states with do-not-work orders or from institutions that have shuttered their research operations, there may be no decision to make about whether to continue fieldwork. But those that the virus has been slow to find are now faced with a choice: continue field measurements and manipulations or halt them voluntarily and accept the cost to their science and sometimes their budgets.
